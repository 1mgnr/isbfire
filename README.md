SCORING LOGIC //todo

- **Defining Scoring Criteria:** Maintain the attributes like clarity, relevance, depth, etc., but adjust the scoring guidelines to focus on the summarized content.
- **Scoring Process:** Evaluate the summarized content against each attribute and use the weighted average method (or any preferred method) to calculate a single score. This score would reflect the candidate's performance across the entire conversation thread, now summarized into a cohesive narrative.
